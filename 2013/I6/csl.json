    "abstract": "Weak cathodal current applied to the tongue inhibits the taste of salt, but perceived saltiness tends to increase after the current is released. In this study, we propose a saltiness enhancer that uses this phenomenon. Our system applies weak cathodal current for a short time when the user eats or drinks. The user can thus perceive a salty taste without the use of salt.",
