title: 'Enhancing saltiness with cathodal current'
author:
  - 'Hiromi Nakamura'
  - 'Homei Miyashita'
abstract: 'Weak cathodal current applied to the tongue inhibits the taste of salt, but perceived saltiness tends to increase after the current is released. In this study, we propose a saltiness enhancer that uses this phenomenon. Our system applies weak cathodal current for a short time when the user eats or drinks. The user can thus perceive a salty taste without the use of salt.'
