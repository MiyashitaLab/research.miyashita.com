    "abstract": "Digital fabrication and physical computing have become widespread, andthe \feld of electronics has recently attracted the general public, requiring a novice userto understand speci\fcations of parts. A user is often demotivated when learning withspeci\fcation sheets and without real experience. In this thesis, we present a system toachieve both, a sense of reality and high-speed learning through trial and error.  Oursystem uses lighting with projection mapping, even over 3D printed mock-ups, to createa software simulator with a high sense of reality, thereby motivating users to learn. Thispaper describes the con\fguration of the system and presents user feedback received fromthe demonstration of the system.",
