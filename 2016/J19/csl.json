    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose \"ExtensionSticker\", a striped pattern sticker that can extend touch interface by simply attaching the sticker to a touch panel display. This sticker has multiple conductive lines, and when the user touches on the sticker, a touch input can be generated. This method is not only touch input as speci\fc locations, but allows for continuous touch input such as scrolling operation. This allows a user to prototype an interface to extend touch panel devices easily. Furthermore, we experimented on the recognition accuracy of scroll and tap actions using the proposed method.",
