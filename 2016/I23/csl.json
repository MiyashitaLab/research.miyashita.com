    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a tangible interface that can realize touch operations on a physical object. We printed physical objects that have conductive striped patterns using a multi-material 3D printer. The ExtensionSticker technique allows the user to operate capacitive touch-panel devices by tapping, scrolling, and swiping the physical object. By shaping the structure of conductive wiring inside a physical object, a variety of interfaces can be realized. We examined the conditions for using our proposed method on touch-panel devices.",
