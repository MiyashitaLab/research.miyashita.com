    "abstract": "The steering law is a robust model for expressing the relationship between movement time and task difficulty. Recently, a corrected model to calculate the steering time difference between narrowing and widening tunnels was proposed. However, the previous work only conducted a user study with straight paths. This paper presents an investigation of steering performance in narrowing and widening circular tunnels to confirm the corrected model as being either adequate or a limitation. The results show that the steering law achieves a good fit (R2>.98) without the corrected model, thereby indicating the limited benefit of employing the corrected model.",
