    "abstract": "We propose a tactile element that can generate both an electrostatic force and an electrostimulus, and can be used to provide tactile feedback on a wide area of human skin such as the palm of the hand. Touching the flat surface through the our proposed tactile element allow the user to feel both uneven and rough textures. In addition, the element can be fabricated using double-sided inkjet printing with conductive ink. Use of a flexible substrate, such as a PET film or paper, allows the user to design a free-formed tactile element. In this demonstration, we describe the implementation of the proposed stimuli element and show examples of applications.",
