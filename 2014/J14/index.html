Our purpose is to make it easier to digitally render the scratched brushstrokes and other expressions of calligraphy which had been difficult to achieve with drawing tools and to propose a new mode of expression by incorporating the electronic musical instruments metaphor. With a sampler metaphor, the user scans reference calligraphy images by tracing the strokes with a mouse-pointer and rewrites the calligraphy by outputting sampled images on the drawing window. With a synthesizer metaphor, we aimed to create digital brushstrokes in the way that synthesizers create sounds. We propose this as a function that has the ability to design expressions with a scratched or blurred look. We designed this system based on the principles of electronic music devices, and built this metaphor by adding further editing functions: an envelope controller and a mixer.
