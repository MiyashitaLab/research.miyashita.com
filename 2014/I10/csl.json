    "abstract": "With this system, you can make electronic circuits using trial and error and learn how each element works. You can connect or disconnect circuits by finger tracing. What is special with this system is that LEDs and matrix LEDs appear to emit light because light is projected to the parts by projection mapping. No current is flowing in the parts! In addition to making LEDs emit light, you can also set off a buzzer. Further, you can turn a switch on or off by covering it with your hand. To make this system easy for beginners, all wires have the appropriate resistors, and this is the default setting of the system. However, you can change this system in such a way that the elements in the system can be damaged by excessive voltage and current.With this system, you can make electronic circuits using trial and error and learn how each element works.

To make this system easy for beginners, all wires have the appropriate resistors, and this is the default setting of the system. However, you can change this system in such a way that the elements in the system can be damaged by excessive voltage and current. \\ A tracing paper is placed on the touch panel display. A projector projects light onto the paper and a camera is used to detect motion. The tracing paper is used to balance the transmitted light from the touch panel and the projected light from the projector. By using the touch panel, you can drag wires to connect or disconnect them. The camera detects shielding of the switch, and AR markers are used for alignment of the optical system. The positions of the parts are not recognized by image recognition; rather, they are registered at the start of system. \\ Since no current is flowing, you can use damaged elements or unopened parts. We believe this system is superior to breadboards because accidents such as breakage of elements and poor connection can be avoided. We are sure you will have a better touch feeling in this system than in breadboards or circuit simulators. Other related studies include HMMBB, which automatically compensate open wires and performs project mapping, and Visible Breadboard, which makes current visible.",
