You can connect or disconnect circuits by finger tracing. What is special with this system is that LEDs and matrix LEDs appear to emit light because light is projected to the parts by projection mapping. No current is flowing in the parts! In addition to making LEDs emit light, you can also set off a buzzer. Further, you can turn a switch on or off by covering it with your hand. To make this system easy for beginners, all wires have the appropriate resistors, and this is the default setting of the system.
